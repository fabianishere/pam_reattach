.Sh DESCRIPTION
The reattach authentication module is used to move the next authentication
modules to the correct, per-session, bootstrap namespace.

The following options may be passed to this authentication module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm default_principal"
.It Cm ignore_ssh
Detect and ignore probable SSH sessions. This helps prevent erroneously
prompting for a touch when SSH and a terminal multiplexer like 
.Xr tmux 1
is in use. This detection is based on the presence of
.Dv $SSH_CLIENT ,
.Dv $SSH_CONNECTION ,
or
.Dv $SSH_TTY
in the environment.
